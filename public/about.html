          The Black Fashion Finder is a platform for understanding and promoting
          Black people’s position within fashion. On this platform, we will
          educate our audience about Black people’s contributions to fashion,
          explore the relationship between Blackness, fashion, and society, and
          promote the positionality of Black people in the fashion industry.

        <h3 style="text-align: left;   margin-left: 16px;"> Our Story</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left; padding-bottom: 100px" >
          The Black Fashion Finder was created in the summer of 2020 by Ogochukwu
          Nwodoh. During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ogochukwu
          started buying clothing from smaller clothing brands because she wanted
          to support them through the economic turmoil of the pandemic.
          <br/>
          While she sought out smaller clothing brands, Ogochukwu started
          discovering Black-owned clothing brands. Ogochukwu fell in love with
          their creations and wanted to capture her discoveries somewhere.
          Before going on this journey, she was not aware that there were so
          many Black people in fashion creating innovative brands.
          <br/>
          Therefore, Ogochukwu built the Black Fashion Finder to promote the
          current and past contributions of Black people to fashion.
          Ogochukwu wants to see a world where Black people receive more
          credit for their impact on fashion.
