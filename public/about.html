          The Black Fashion Finder is a permanent space for recognizing and
          celebrating all Black contribution to fashion. Historically, the fashion
          industry has ignored and stolen the significant contributions to fashion
          that Black people have made. Only a few Black people are credited for
          their work when itâ€™s popularized by celebrities and/or endorsed by
          white-owned fashion media. The Black Fashion Finder wants to change this
          dynamic by recognizing the contributions of Black (co-)owned fashion
          labels. Our mission is to increase the visibility of these fashion
          labels by showcasing the work of these labels on our app and writing
          about the innovative things these labels are doing.<br/><br/>
          <i>Any</i> Black (co-)owned fashion label can be listed on the Black
          Fashion Finder. The Black Fashion Finder envisions a future where
          everyone is included in fashion regardless of skin color, gender, class,
          nationality, ability, or sexuality.
