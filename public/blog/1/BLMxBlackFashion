        <div style="padding-top:16px;padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px"><b>What
          has been the fashion community&#39;s response to the 2020 BLM movement?</b></div>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Lives Matter Movement has
          challenged all facets of society to examine how they contribute to
          systemic racism and the fashion industry is no exception. This year
          we saw fashion stores vandalized during Black Lives Matter protests
          and calls on social media for fashion brands to take meaningful action
          towards fighting system racism.
          <br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from most major fashion brands
          has been lackluster at best. When the Black Lives Matter movement gained traction in late
          May, brands were slow and hesitant to respond. Brands like Fendi and
          Revolve posed graphics with short, nondescript messages, shared a
          couple fashion pics of black people, then went back to posting mostly
          white fashion models and ignoring the situation. Some major brands did
          make donations. Nike announced a $40 million dollar commitment to
          support the Black community in the U.S. and, after backlash, Revolve
          made amends for their original response by pledging to donate $1
          million dollars to the fight for racial inequality. While these
          efforts sound promising, only time will tell if these companies follow
          through with their pledges and realize that making donations is just
          the tip of the iceberg.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Black Lives Matter Movement has
            challenged all facets of society to examine how they contribute to
            systemic racism and the fashion industry is no exception. This year

            and calls on social media for fashion brands to take meaningful action
            towards fighting system racism.
            <br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the fashion industry as whole has
            contributed to systemic racism, Black fashion designers have been
            at the forefront of combating this racism and pushing the industry to do better
            . In 2017 Telfar Clemens collaborated with White Castle on a collection
            whose proceeds were used to bail out young people in jail. In 2015,
            Pyer Moss showcased a Black Lives Matter themed collection. Black
            fashion designers have exemplified how the fashion industry can fix
            it&#39;s issues with system racism. During the 2020 Black Lives Matter
            movement more Black fashion designers are leading the charge in
            contributing to the movement. Here is a list of some of their efforts:

                Regina Jones who is the owner of Ginny&#39;s Girl Gang. Regina is an
                indigenous Gomeroi/Gamilaraay artist and a native of Australia.
                She sells custom hand-painted jackets with important messages
                about the stories of Black, indigenous Austrailians.

              <p>
                Fear of God decided to sell a t-shirt with the initials &apos;GF&apos;
                for George Floyd, which is it&apos;s brand&apos;s logo flipped. The brand
                also collaborated with Off-White, Pyer Moss, and Denim Tears,
                which are all Black owned, and other non-black owned brands to put
                their logos on the t-shirt and show support for the initiative.

                which celebrates people who have fought for Black freedom since
