          Here&rsquo;s a quick introduction to the Black Fashion Finder!
          <br/><br/>
          <b>What is the Black Fashion Finder?</b><br/>
          The Black Fashion Finder is a permanent space to celebrate all Black
          contribution to fashion. Right now it is trendy for major
          publications to talk about Black fashion, specifically black designers.
          However, within a couple months, if not a couple weeks, these publications
          will go back to mostly posting about white people in fashion. I want to
          create a platform where Black people in fashion are centered, recognized,
          and celebrated all the time. <br/><br/>
          <b>What will the Black Fashion Finder consist of?</b><br/>
          The Black fashion finder will have a directory of Black-owned fashion
          labels and blog posts about various topics in Black fashion.
          I don&rsquo;t support a consumerist/black-capitalist agenda, so I
          want to make sure that imagery and art is centered as much as possible.
          That being said, I do want Black-owned brands to receive the proper
          recognition and monetary compensation they deserve, so I will maintain
          and expand the directory of Black-owned fashion labels.<br/><br/>
          <b>What was the thought behind the Black Fashion Finder?</b><br/>
          There was a time during COVID-19 where I was looking for small clothing
          businesses to support and I kept coming across all these Black-owned
          small fashion brands that I had never heard of.
          Their creations were very unique and I had never seen those types of
          clothes sold in large retailers. This app was created because I wanted to capture the unique
          aesthetics of these brands and help tell their stories. <br/><br/>
          <b>What Black-owned fashion labels will be available on the black fashion finder?</b><br/>
          I want ALL Black-owned fashion labels to be featured on the Black Fashion Finder.
          I will publish another blog post about how a label can request themselves to be added.
          Any Black-owned fashion label
          can request to be added as long as they provide the necessary information.
          I don&rsquo;t just want celebrity endorsed brands. I want local brands,
          brands who are are not present on social media, brands that are niche,
          and more to be represented on this app :)<br/><br/>
