        <p>As a part of our goal of celebrating all Black contribution to fashion we&rsquo;ve built in the ability for any Black-owned fashion label to be listed on the Black Fashion Finder.
          <br/><br/>
          Here&rsquo;s a 6 step guide on how any Black-owned Fashion label can be added to the Black Fashion Finder.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>There is a form on the Black Fashion Finder website for requesting a fashion label to be added to the Black Fashion Finder. You can access the form through 2 ways.&nbsp;
              <ul>
                <li>Open the Black Fashion Finder App, click on the &#39;More&#39; tab, and click on the button &#39;Add A Fashion Label&#39;. You will be taken to the form.</li>
                <li>You can access the form <a href="https://blackfashionfinder.com/submit">here</a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          <li>
            <p>The first part of the form asks for information about who is filling out the form and their email. We would like this information so that we can contact you when reviewing the fashion label if any questions arise.</p>
            <img src="form1.png" class="use-border" width="75%" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-top: 16px;display: block"/>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The next part of the form asks for information about the fashion label: the label name, the owner name, the fashion label mission statement, and an image that will represent the brand. We ask for the owner name because we believe in properly crediting Black people for their work. We ask for a mission statement because we want to tell the stories of these Black-owned brands and we think it&#39;s useful for people to hear them. And we ask for an image to represent the brand because we want to celebrate Black aesthetics. Please upload a high quality image that is a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In this next part of the form we ask for more detailed information about the items the brand sells. We ask for you to check off the items the brand sells so that people can discover the brand. We then ask you to select up the three tags the describe the brand. This will also help people discover the brand. If there is any tag you feel that is missing, feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:info@blackfashionfinder.com">info@blackfashionfinder.com</a> to add the tag. Then we ask for the price information of the brand so that people will be able to find brands that fit into their &nbsp;budget.</p>
