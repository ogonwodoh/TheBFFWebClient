        <p><i>The Remix: Hip-Hop X Fashion</i> is a film that profiles several Black
          visionaries in the hip-hop fashion space. The film highlights how
          Black fashion in American hip-hop has and continues to influence
          global fashion culture. It also calls attention to the need for
          society to recognize, financially support, and uplift Black people
          in fashion.</p>

      <p>Black people in fashion often start popular trends but have
        precarious careers that are not able to weather changes that negatively
        affect their work. <b> The popularity of Black fashion creations does
        not translate to the longevity of Black-owned fashion businesses</b>.</p>

        </p>

      <p>In the 1980s, Daniel Day, better known as Dapper Dan, opened a boutique
        in Harlem that specialized in custom-made clothing. Dapper Dan&rsquo;s
        trademark was to make streetwear, hip-hop style pieces that consisted of
        bold, luxury monograms from brands like Fendi, MCM, Louis Vuitton, and
        more. Dapper Dan&rsquo;s business was popular among hustlers, street people,
        and Black celebrities. He made clothing for people like LL Cool J, Salt-N-Pepa,
        Mike Tyson, and Bobby Brown.&nbsp;</p>

        </p>

      <p>Despite the success of his 1980s boutique, its survival relied on the
        boutique being relatively unknown, which was not a long-term, sustainable model.
        In 1988 Dapper Dan&apos;s undercover operations were exposed when Mike Tyson
        got in a fight at his store. The press put Dapper Dan&rsquo;s business
        in the media, and consequently, law enforcement spotlight. After the publicity,
        Dapper Dan started continuously getting raided by the authorities due to copyright
        infringement claims by the luxury brands that he used in his custom-made clothing.
        Dapper Dan was not working with any of these luxury brands. He had no legal
        grounds to create the monogrammed pieces he sold. As a result, he took his
        business underground and traveled from city to city to sustain it.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Dapper Dan is just one example of how precarious the careers of Black
        people in fashion are. The film also covers the story of stylist Misa
        Hylton, who worked with Lil&rsquo; Kim, Mary J. Blige, and many other
        prominent people in hip-hop. Although Hylton was responsible for some
        of the most iconic looks in pop culture, the advent of digital music
        piracy in the early 2000s drained the music industry of money and took
        job opportunities away from Hylton. Hylton almost had to give away her
        business and became homeless for some time. &nbsp;</p>

        </p>

      <p>More recently, Carly Cushnie, a Black woman designer, announced that
        her brand, Cushnie, is closing due to the effects of COVID-19. The news
        came as a shock because the brand has been quite popular. Cushnie was
        featured in multiple magazines, worn by celebrities, shown at NYFW,
        and this summer launched a collaboration with Target.</p>

      <p>
      <b>Popularity is not enough to support Black designers. It does not provide
        the security that designers need to sustain a business in an ever-changing
        economy</b>. Black people in fashion need to connect with support systems that
        can weather economic hardship and uncertainty. We need systemic change that allows
        Black people in fashion to either connect with
        larger fashion establishments or create new ones that can help Black people
        in fashion survive in the long-term.</p>

        </p>

      <p>Black people also have a unique brand of creativity that is appropriated
        by non-Black people in fashion and rarely credited. The film discusses
        how Black people have historically practiced the idea of deconstruction,
        which is a behavior where one takes a trend that has been established and
        recreates and reclaims it to fit their comfort, needs, and mood.
        Deconstruction is the driving force of hip-hop fashion. One example is the
        reclamation of Polo Ralph Lauren by hip-hop artists. While it is a reaction
        to being excluded from mainstream fashion, interestingly, the mainstream
        fashion industry steals these deconstructed contributions of Black people and
        claims it as its own.</p>

          April Walker (middle), the founder of Walker Wear.
        </p>

        <p>In 1991, April Walker founded the clothing brand Walker Wear which
          made custom clothing pieces for mostly new money rappers. Walker Wear
          made clothing pieces that fit the needs of their customers; the brand
          would fulfill requests for deep pockets and bottoms that versatility
          fit Timberland boots. The most successful creation of the brand was
          the Rough and Rugged suit that was inspired by the needs and desires
          of customers. Huge rappers like Tupac and Notorious B.I.G. wore the
          brand, and it started growing globally. Unfortunately, as the brand grew,
          other brands stole its signature look. The theft and the lack of credit
          given to April Walker caused her to become disenchanted and eventually
          shut down her brand. She recognized that she was in a cycle where larger
          fashion brands could steal her ideas and not allow her to benefit from the
          hard work she put into developing those ideas.</p>

          </p>

        <p>Misa Hylton has also had her most standout creations stolen by the
          mainstream fashion industry. Hylton has created some of the most
          iconic looks in pop culture, such as Lil&apos; Kim&rsquo;s purple
          1999s MTV VMAs outfit and the &apos;Crush on You,&apos; music video
          monochrome outfits. She is responsible for changing the looks of male
          R&amp;B singers to have more of a hip-hop appearance and of female
          hip-hop and R&amp;B artists to be more feminine.</p>

          <p style="padding: 12px; font-size: 14px; color: #494949">

          </p>

        <p>However, in the film, we learn that Hylton had a hard time expanding
          out of the hip-hop and R&amp;B styling space. When big fashion brands
          would do photoshoots of her clients, they would usually have another
          stylist execute her style or only bring her on the shoot as a consultant.
          To this day, Hylton is still not properly credited for her contributions
          to fashion and culture. Her styling has revolutionized mainstream
          fashion and is responsible for the careers of many figures in pop culture.</p>

        <p><b>Black people have a unique type of creativity that needs to be protected</b>.
          Black fashion is a way for Black people to escape racism. It is a space
          where Black people can express their pain and temporarily escape
          from it. Black people in fashion deserve the world. They have
          made monumental contributions to fashion with little resources and support.
          It is time for our culture to look back and acknowledge how Black people
          have shaped the fashion industry. It is also time for our culture to
          look forward and come up with ways to uplift current Black creatives in
          fashion. <b>We need to have a cultural shift where hip-hop, ghetto, hood,
          and all Black fashion is considered high fashion</b> and Black creatives are
          given a chance to participate in mainstream fashion.</p>
