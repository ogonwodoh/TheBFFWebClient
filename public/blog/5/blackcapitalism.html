             Us: Some Thoughts on Aurora James&rsquo; 15% Pledge</h3>
        </div>
        <img src="main.jpg" width="100%"/>
        <p style="padding-top: 16px">Aurora James, founder of the brand Brother Vellies, created the 15%
          Pledge which calls for major retailers to dedicate 15% of their
          shelf space to Black owned businesses. The Pledge has gained a lot of
          attention and some major retailers, like Sephora and Rent the Runway,
          have agreed to the pledge.</p>

            From Aurora James&rsquo; personal Instagram account.
          </p>
          <p>One of the claims made by James is that by retailers investing in
          Black businesses, &ldquo;[b]anks will be forced to take them seriously
          because they will be walking in with major purchase orders...Investors
          for the very first time will start actively seeking them out. Small
          businesses can turn into bigger ones. Real investment will start
          happening in Black businesses which will subsequently be paid
          forward into our Black communities.&rdquo; Although it is
          commendable to invest in Black businesses - Black people deserve to
          be credited and paid fairly, we need to be honest about the limits of
          buying Black.&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="padding: 12px; font-size: 14px; color: #494949">
            <img src="reparations.png" width="100%"/>
            On the 15% Pledge Instagram this post compares the pledge
            to reparations for Black people. Reparations means different things
            to different people, but a common thought is that it is a payment
            from the government to all Black descendents of slaves which compensates
            for the economic disadvantage that slavery and Jim Crow inflicted on
            African-Americans.
          </p>
          <p>James&rsquo; claims about the power of investing in Black businesses
          aligns with the Black capitalism movement, a political movement among
          Black people that touts building wealth through ownership and
          entrepreneurship as the solution to racial inequality. While I personally
          love seeing wealthy Black people who give back to their community,
          Black capitalism can never be a solution to the deep history of racial inequality.
          &ldquo;Years of compounded divestment have made the politics of black capitalism
          useless&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/nipsey-killer-mike-race-economics/">The Nation</a>). Black people as a collective do not have
          the power to change the economic state of the Black community. Black
          people with money still face racism (although it is less severe than
          the racism felt by poor Black people). Nigeria has the most amount of
          Black billionaires (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2018/03/07/the-black-billionaires-2018/#505d9bb15234">Forbes</a>), yet struggles with serious economic
          inequality which is perpetuated by Nigerian billionaires.
          And &ldquo;even renowned activists like W.E.B. Du Bois and Madam C.J.
          Walker owned black slums and busted black unions&rdquo; (<a
          href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/nipsey-killer-mike-race-economics/">The Nation</a>).
          We cannot depend on wealthy Black people to uplift poor Black people.
          We cannot forget that Black capitalism is still capitalism - not
          everybody will win in capitalism; somebody will be oppressed.</p>
          <p>Buying Black is not the key to the economic empowerment of the
          Black community and there is little evidence of a &ldquo;trickle-down&rdquo;
          effect from empowering Black businesses. Economic empowerment needs to
          be systemic. It needs to directly benefit poor and working class people.
          It needs to be government led. We should not believe that generating
          wealth for the small amount of businesses that will benefit from the 15%
          Pledge will help with a large scale issue.
          While I obviously am in support of buying Black, we need to not be
          blinded by the capitalist promises of buying Black. It is only a drop
          in the bucket. The Black community and our allies need to look further
          and confront the reality that racism is deeply ingrained in this country
          and a buy Black movement is just the beginning.</p><br/><br/>
