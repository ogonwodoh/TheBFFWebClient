        Black Fashion Fair, an organization that uplifts Black people in fashion
        through various mediums like exhibitions, publications, and clothing
        collaborations, has come out with a new collection, "Those Who Dress Better,"
        in partnership with The Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.
        <br/><br/>
        The collaboration features nine prominent Black designers that have
        created pieces inspired by Basquiat's work. The pieces range from shoes
        to jewelry to dresses. The collaboration is on display at the Jean-Michel
        Basquiat: King Pleasure exhibition. Some items from the partnership
        are also available for purchase.
        <br/><br/>
        This line is a testament to the relationship between fashion and art. It
         speaks to Jean-Michel Basquiat's present and future relevancy.
