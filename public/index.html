        The Black Fashion Finder is a permanent space for recognizing and
        celebrating all Black contribution to fashion. Historically, the fashion
        industry has ignored and stolen the significant contributions to fashion
        that Black people have made. Only a few Black people are credited for
        their work when itâ€™s popularized by celebrities and/or endorsed by
        white-owned fashion media. The Black Fashion Finder wants to change this
        dynamic by recognizing the contributions of Black (co-)owned fashion
        labels. Our mission is to increase the visibility of these fashion
        labels by showcasing the work of these labels on our app and writing
        about the innovative things these labels are doing.<br/><br/>
        <i>Any</i> Black (co-)owned fashion label can be featured on the Black
        Fashion Finder. The Black Fashion Finder envisions a future where
        everyone is included in fashion regardless of skin color, gender, class,
        nationality, ability, or sexuality.
