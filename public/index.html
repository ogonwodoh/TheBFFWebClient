      <p>
        The Black Fashion Finder is a permanent space for recognizing and
        celebrating Black contribution to fashion. Historically, Black people
        have made significant contributions to fashion, yet Black people are
        rarely credited for their work. There are only a few Black people that
        are credited for their work when they are popularized by celebrities or
        endorsed by white-owned fashion media. The Black Fashion Finder focuses
        on Black (co-)owned fashion labels. The mission is to increase the
        visibility of these fashion labels by featuring these labels on our app
        and writing about the innovative things these labels are doing. <br/><br/>
        Any black (co-)owned fashion label can be featured on the Black Fashion
        Finder. The Black Fashion Finder envisions a feature where everyone is
        included in fashion regardless of skin color, gender, class,
        nationality, ability, or sexuality.<br/><br/>You can download our app on
        the iOS App Store.
